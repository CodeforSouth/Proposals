1. [Flood Tracker](https://codeforsouth.org/projects/iot-flood-tracker/) - In 2018, we worked on building IoT Flood Trackers that were placed indoors and in the City of Coral Gable. The problem we identified was Miami / South Florida’s rising tides that were unexpected. Through a partnership effort, we worked on getting a community of people who setup, designed, and built their own IoT Flood Trackers using Particle.io.

2. [Get Your Refund](https://codeforsouth.org/projects/getyourrefund-org/) - During the coronavirus pandemic, many South Florida organizations who helped people file taxes in-person for free were struggling to transition to virtual tax assistance. In response, to help Florida citizens we launched GetYourRefund.org in Florida training 5 volunteer income assistance organizations and working with Code for America’s product team to help people file for their taxes. Code for South Florida was the first non-profit in the Code for America Network to lead a project that later led to funding for our national partner.

3. [Local Air](https://codeforsouth.org/projects/localair/) - 1 out of 8 deaths in the world is due to poor air quality. Our Local Air project is a part of our Smart City Initiative focused on discovering and prototyping user-centered approaches to helping cities inform and engage residents using data. This work started in 2019 and was deployed in 2020. Currently, we are in the second phase where have deployed solar-powered sensors in our community.

4. [People Budget](https://codeforsouth.org/projects/peoplebudget/) - Elected officials at the state and local level often take limited resident feedback when making budgetary decisions. In Miami, we saw increased public feedback with elected officials not listening to all the feedback. This is what inspired PeopleBudget an open-source effort to bring public budgeting and drive civic inclusion through new models of engaging the general public in things related to the budget for community organizations and government.
