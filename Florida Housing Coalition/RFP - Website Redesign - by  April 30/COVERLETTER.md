## Dear Lisa Djahed,

Thank you for posting your Request for Proposal for Website Redesign:www.flhousing.org. I found out about it through Myranda L Pierce at Code for America. I am helping lead and organize Code for South Florida which is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit and nonpartisan organization. We help governments and non-profits learn modern practices to designing and building products that leverage user feedback to improve products and services.  

Most importantly, we align with your vision of all Floridians having a quality affordable home and suitable living environment. As individuals and community members, this is very important to us and we'd love to help partner with you on the website redesign.

Thank you,

## Code for South Florida
